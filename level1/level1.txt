New String Methods to Remove Prefixes and Suffixes
str.removeprefix(prefix) and str.removesuffix(suffix) have been added to easily remove an unneeded prefix or a suffix from a string. Corresponding bytes, bytearray, and collections.UserString methods have also been added. See PEP 616 for a full description. (Contributed by Dennis Sweeney in bpo-39939.)
